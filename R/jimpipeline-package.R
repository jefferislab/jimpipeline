#' Package to wrap Jefferis lab image processing pipeline
#' 
#' This contains functions that we use during our large scale image processing
#' and registration work. We will try to make these as generic as possible, but
#' for the moment use by third parties is not a major design consideration.
#' @section Package Options: The following options can be set to specify default
#'   behaviour.
